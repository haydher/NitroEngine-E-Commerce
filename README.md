## NitroEngine - E-Commerce Website

This project was made in January of 2021.

This website was made with NodeJs, ExpressJs, MongoDB, Mongoose, EJS, S3, and it's hosted on Heroku.

NitroEngine is a fully functional E-commerce website. The website uses JWT for user authentication, S3 for storing the images for items, and MongoDB for the database. All the clothing items and other products are picked based on user needs.

NitroEngine offers a fully functional Admin panel to track remaining stock, update existing stock and repopulate with more items.
